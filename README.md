# Ai&U: AI Avatar Interview Preparation Platform

## Inspiration
In the hectic moments before a job interview, users often experience a range of emotions from nervousness to self-doubt. Traditional interview preparation methods, such as rehearsing responses or seeking advice from friends and mentors, often lack personalized feedback and fail to simulate the dynamic nature of real interview scenarios. Our inspiration for Ai&U stemmed from our collective experiences and user research, revealing common issues like "nervousness," "lack of feedback," and "difficulty answering certain types of questions." Recognizing the growing importance of AI technology, we saw an opportunity to leverage it to create a solution that addresses these shortcomings.
